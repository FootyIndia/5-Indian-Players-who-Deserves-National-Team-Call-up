        <h1><b class="heading">5 Indian Players who Deserves National Team Call-up</b></h1>
        <h6>13 Mar 2023 | Written By Shyam Sundar</h6>
        <img class="prev" src="https://www.linkpicture.com/q/png_20230313_210302_0000.png" alt="" height=400px>
        <br>
        <p>
          The Indian National Team is all set to participate in the Hero Tri-Nation series against the likes of 
          Kyrgyzstan and Myanmar. Indian Coach Igor Stimac has hinted that he might not call players for the upcoming camp from
          teams who feature in the finals as they might not have enough recovery time. So, we will have a look at 5 players who have
          been brilliant this season and deserves a national team call-up.
          <br>
          <br>
        <h4><b class="heading">Naorem Mahesh:</b></h4>
        <img class="prev" src="https://www.indiansuperleague.com/static-resources/waf-images/content//ea/a2/e1/16-9/tygSaHhzX4.jpg" alt="" height=400px>

        <p>
          Mahesh Singh has been one of the best (if not the best) Indian left winger in the league this season. He has scored 2 goals and has provided
          a further 7 assists in a struggling East Bengal side. His overall game has been impressive and looks a more complete winger. With the likes of Liston 
          Colaco and Sahal being off colors, Mahesh might get a chance to impress Stimac and stamp his place in the National Team. 
          <br>
          <br />
        </p>
        <h4><b class="heading">Aakash Sangwan:</b></h4>
        <img class="prev" src="https://www.indiansuperleague.com/static-resources/waf-images/content//23/89/1e/16-9/F2i13Qv1aT.jpg" alt="" height=400px>
        <p style="text-align:center">Image Courtesy : ISL Media</p>
        <p>
          Aakash Sangwan joined Chennaiyin FC this season from RoundGlass Punjab FC. While he has enormous experience in the I-League, no one expected him to 
          perform the way he has done this season. Aakash has been a mainstay in Thomas Brdaric's team keeping the likes of Narayan Das on the bench.
          Aakash has registered 5 assists and has created 26 chances this season, which is the most by a defender this season. He was also rock solid in the defensive 
          third making him one of the best left-backs in the league this season. With Subasish and Naorem Roshan set to play the finals, Aakash Sangwan might get
          a call-up for the upcoming camp.
          <br>
          <br />
        </p>
        <h4><b class="heading">Phurba Lachenpa:</b></h4>
        <img class="prev" src="https://www.mumbaicityfc.com/static-assets/waf-images/75/bf/e5/16-9/YgRxIvV0z0.jpg?v=1.19&w=1200" alt="" height=400px>
        <p style="text-align:center">Image Courtesy : MCFC Media</p>
        <p>
          How many of you remember when Sergio Lobera famously substituted Phurba in for the penalties against FC Goa in the 2020-21 Semi-Finals? He managed to win the game for the Islanders and helped them win the double. 
          Phurba replaced Nawaz in the AFC Champions League campaign and has kept his place ever since. He has kept 7 clean sheets this season and has made some important saves in Mumbai City's 
          ISL Shield triumph. Igor Stimac would consider calling Lachenpa for the upcoming camp as other national team regulars like Amrinder and Dheeraj Singh has been pretty average this season.
          <br>
          <br />
        </p>
        <h4><b class="heading">Ritwik Das:</b></h4>
        <img class="prev" src="https://www.indiansuperleague.com/static-resources/waf-images/content//42/25/88/16-9/1jbO4iOTHy.JPG" alt="" height=400px>
        <p style="text-align:center">Image Courtesy : ISL Media</p>
        <p>
          Ritwik Das has been one of the best Indian wingers in the league over the past two seasons. He was unfortunate to miss out on the last National Camp, as he was injured at that time. But, he has 
          worked hard and has had yet another brilliant season in a lackluster Jamshedpur side. The 26-year old has scored 6 goals this season and is Jamshedpur FC's top goal scorer beating the likes of Daniel
          Chima and Ishan Pandita. It will be intersting to see if Ritwik makes the final cut ahead of Bipin Singh and Mahesh who have also been absolutely brilliant this season.
          <br>
          <br />
        </p>
        <h4><b class="heading">Mehtab Singh:</b></h4>
        <img class="prev" src="https://www.indiansuperleague.com/static-resources/waf-images/content//0d/9e/91/16-9/jn2Y5GbZwo.jpg" alt="" height=400px>
        <p style="text-align:center">Image Courtesy : ISL Media</p>
        <p>
          Despite missing the penalty in the semi-finals, Mehtab has had one of his best seasons in the Hero ISL. While Des Buckingham changed Rostyn Griffiths and Mourtada Fall, Mehtab has always been 
          a constant presence in the Mumbai backline that went on a 18-game unbeaten streak.  He is the highest scoring defender this season with 2 goals. The 24-year old has had the second most passes in the league this season and also
          tops the charts for multiple defensive stats and looks very assured defensively. While quality Indian Centre Backs have always been a rare commodity in the ISL, it looks like we have found an absolute gem in Mehtab Singh.
